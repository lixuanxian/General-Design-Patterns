General Design Patterns
=======================

This Xcode project contains an implementation for the following general design patterns:

* Composite
* Iterator
* Visitor
* Factory method
* Builder
* Facade

The code represents mathematical formulas as an abstract syntax tree (AST). Supported operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. The operations are nodes of the tree, the numbers are leafs. Brackets are created implicitly.
